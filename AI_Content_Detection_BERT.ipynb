This paper aims to describe the five basic process types by comparing and contrasting them using examples. Historically, people first mastered job shops and batches’ processes, while repetitive and continuous processes appeared only after the industrial revolution. Job shops involve the production of a variety of products in small quantities. This process requires great flexibility of equipment and high-skilled personnel, allowing a wide variety of work. Still, the drawbacks of this type include high cost per unit and complex scheduling. An example of the job shops is a jewelry repair shop or veterinarian services. Batches are used for medium production and moderate product variety. A good example is bakeries or services for groups of people, like air travel. This type’s advantage is a high level of flexibility, and the disadvantages are moderate cost per unit and scheduling complexity. Examples of repetitive process type products are production lines for cars, TVs, pencils. The advantage of this type is that it allows large volumes, but the disadvantages are the high cost of equipment downtime and low flexibility. The continuous process involves the production of the highest volumes, rigid equipment, and low-skilled personnel. Examples of a continuous process type are sugar, flour, gasoline, steel production, and supplying electricity or the Internet. This type’s disadvantages are its rigidity and low variety; its advantages are high volumes and efficiency. Project process type is usually chosen in project work cases, for example, when filming a movie, publishing a book, building a dam.
